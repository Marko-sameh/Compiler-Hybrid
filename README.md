# Compiler-Hybrid
Compiler &amp; Hybrid code.

Compilers are essential tools in computer science, translating high-level programming languages into machine-readable formats. This process allows developers to write human-readable code while enabling machines to execute optimized instructions. Compilers are divided into various phases, such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization, and code generation. These phases ensure that code is processed systematically, guaranteeing accuracy and efficiency.

Hybrid combines features of both traditional compilers and interpreters, providing a balance between speed and flexibility. They compile source code into an intermediate representation, such as bytecode, which is then executed by a virtual machine or runtime environment. This approach enables platform independence, faster execution compared to purely interpreted languages, and easier debugging compared to fully compiled languages. Examples include Java's use of bytecode for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and Python's compilation into .pyc files for the Python interpreter. This hybrid methodology enhances software portability, runtime performance, and development ease.
